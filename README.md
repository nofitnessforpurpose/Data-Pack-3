# Data-Pack-3
Organiser I & Organiser II - Data Pack Case - Smooth - Pre-Release

A 3D Model file of a PSION Organiser II (all family) Data Pack Case. The intention to allow design of modified cases and enable part clearance of electronics within the case to be more readily determined, this version is smooth.

<br>  
All the files are required for a complete case assembly. The default repository format is STEP (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303"> ISO 10303</a> ) due to its high fidelity.  { STL files are surface geometry as opposed to solid model representations, often containing export processing artifacts }. <br>  
<br>  
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.freecad.org/" > FreeCAD </a> may prove suitable for viewing, handling and, if desired modifying STEP files.

### On-Line Preview   
Models might be viewed on line using the following links. Noting display of any mesh lines is a feature of the renderer and are not contained in the source STEP model. It is strongly recommended to use the source STEP file where ever possible, as any export process will introduce artifacts.

## Considerations
The model makes no accomodation for manufacturing tolerances, process or material - see Notes below. 
A smooth case may prove impracticable in use as it would prove very difficult to remove.
